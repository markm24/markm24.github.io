summary: I have been in marching band since high school and through college for Roosevelt High School and the University of Hawai'i at Manoa
---

I have been in marching band since my Freshman year of high school at Roosevelt High School (2013 - 2017) and I am also currently marching for the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (2017 - current). I play the tuba in marching band but also for concert band as well. For my Junior and Senior year of high school, I was promoted to the role of section leader. I was also the only the only tuba in the band for my senior year. It might make you wonder "then he was a section leader of what?" Don't worry, I was a section leader of the group of people who played low brass instruments, or instruments that were classified as brass instruments that played in a lower register, not just the tubas. More simply put, I was a "low brass section leader."

From my years in marching band I was able to learn how to work with a large group of people to create a generally large-scale project, such as making a marching performance and to be able to balance an extra activity while being in school. In my last couple years of high school I also learned how to be responsible for a group of people in my time as section leader for the low brass.
