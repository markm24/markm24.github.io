summary: A program that simulates bank records being stored in a database I made in ICS 212
---

This project comes in the form of a program that is supposed to simulate bank records being put into a database. The program runs on a console and was made using Unix for file traversing and compilation of the code that was created entirely of C. When running this program, you would input a number that would act as an option feature that would let you add a new record to the database, delete one, or access a record to see its contents printed on the console.

The project was entirely done by me, in which I had to create all of the functions to add or delete records from a list as well as functions that saved the list between program runs, by writing that list to a file and later reading it for the next use.

From doing this project, I was able to practice C programming on a medium scale project, which I was learning for the first time taking this course (ICS 212), as well as how to deal with relatively difficult and intricate algorithms to make sure that the program would work without any bugs or errors. In this course, I also used Unix and this project helped me practice with console commands.
