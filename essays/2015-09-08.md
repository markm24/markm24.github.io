## JavaScript is Loosey-Goosey

For the beginning of my fourth semester of being a Computer Science major in college, I was told that I would have to learn my fourth programming language: JavaScript. "Alright," I thought to myself, "time to start from scratch again." However, I have been pleasantly surprised so far at my level of understanding of the language being that it has only been a week since I started learning it. Perhaps I just got better at learning new languages, or maybe it is the fact that JavaScript is easily understandable, but between learning Java, C, and a tiny bit of C++ (which is not just like programming in C but adding one to each line) I was expecting to feel lost for the first couple weeks of this class, but I feel pretty caught up to speed already.

About the programming language itself, one of the things I noticed immediately is that instead of datatypes such as int,  char, float, or sting, etc., the online tutorial told me to type something called "var". After that I was just like "...woah... What?.. So lik-... So wh-wha-, so what about data types and stuff?... Jeez, I'll never get used to this." The next day, I was blazing through the rest of the tutorial, making vars without hesitation, but now I'd be scared of going back to C and seeing a type disagreement. "var" is a one-size-fits-all data type that even covers this:  []. A var in itself can be an array! One of the more useful parts about this fact is that now you don't have to dedicate a function to a specific return type, meaning that you can return something like an int or an error message (in the form of a sting) from a single function. I don't like commitment, so just being able to put "function" instead of a return type is helpful. To see what a function looks like in JavaScript, look below.

function isItOne(val) {  // val is the inputted number that we be checked by the function
  if (val === 1) {
    return 1;            // the function returns 1 if val is 1
  } else {
    return "THAT WASN\'T ONE!"; // the function returns this string is val isn't 1
  }                             // note the \', the \ is to let ' appear in the string
}

function isItOne(val) {  // val is the inputted number that will be checked by the function
  if (val === 1) {
    return 1;            // the function returns 1 if val is 1
  } else {
    return "THAT WASN\'T ONE!"; // the function returns this string if val isn't 1
  }                             // note the \', the \ is there to let ' appear in the string
}

Unlike var, there was one important feature that gave me some trouble understanding the first time, which was an object. Conceptually, a JavaScript object is similar to a Java objects or structs in C, however, it could very well be the formatting of an object that threw me off in JavaScript. I think it would just be easiest to show what an object looks like first, then explain it.

var person = {
  "name": "Bill Billson",
  "age": 5,
  "hobby": "Being Bill",
  12: "is a number"
};

Notice that it is defined like a regular var, where you have "var name = ..." and ends with a ; after the closing bracket. The contents of the object are defined in the curly braces {}. Also, every property of an object is named and defined with a '" ": var'. There are a couple ways to access properties of an object, such as person.name or person["name"], or person[12] would give you "is a number".
